**Spiral** is a D level unit about, unsurprisingly, spiral similarities and Miquel points.
These two concepts show up very frequently in all types of geometry problems, ranging from easy to hard,
[Config Geo](@/G/configgeo.md) to [Weird Geo](@/G/weirdgeo.md).
Together with [Invert](@/G/invert.md),
these concepts can be thought as the bread and butter of olympiad geometry.
If you've done both, or are feeling adventurous, try doing [Inversion and Spiral](@/G/kansas.md),
a Z unit which combines both topics into one unit.
In terms of difficulty, this unit is fairly middle of the road for D units,
but there are a couple tricky problems.

Note: if you've done all the problems in EGMO chapter 10, then there should be no new content for you,
so you don't really need to request this unit.
But it is a good practice set of problems to brush up on geo if you are rusty.

## Content

Say you have a quadrilateral $ABCD$.
If you intersect opposite sides, you get two more points,
$P=\overline{AB}\cap\overline{CD}$ and $Q=\overline{BC}\cap\overline{DA}$.
You can think of these as the intersection of the diagonals of the
self-intersecting quadrilaterals $ACBD$ and
$ADBC$.
It turns out that 4 circumcircles in this diagram concur at a point $M$,
called the Miquel point. This point has a plethora of many different properties,
the most basic of which is that it is the center of the spiral similarity that
sends $\overline{AD}\mapsto\overline{BC}$.
If $ABCD$ is cyclic,
$M$ has even more nice properties.

This configuration is ubiquitous in olympiad geometry for how generic it is.
It is like a chameleon, it can change into many different shapes and forms
through self-intersecting and even degenerate cases, which can sometimes make it tough spot in the wild.
Make sure you know it well!

## Advice

Because spiral sim and Miquel points are basically just abstracted away angle chasing,
they aren't really that high powered.
So you can often solve many problems using a different method like inversion, bypassing the spiral sim.

## Notable Problems

- [IMO 1979/3](https://aops.com/community/p367352): This problem is from 1979,
  yet it still finds a way to be quite tricky. It is required, so there's no way around the weird geo.
- T6POP: A very short and sweet problem that makes you feel nice after solving it.
- [TSTST 2013/4](https://aops.com/community/p3181482): This is a locus problem,
  something you don't see very often. It's quite the oddity.
- [December TST 2013/3](https://aops.com/community/p3161942): This is the final example problem in EGMO,
  and also appears in [Config Geo](@/G/configgeo.md). Nonetheless, you can solve it here as well.
  But be warned, it's quite nontrivial.
